# JagHub Opportunities Page

The opportunities page can be said to have three parts. The first part is the “Explore” section, which hosts app links to advisory articles pertaining to extracurricular activities and a spotlighted high school competition. Next is the Explore section which provides a database of all the North Creek clubs and national clubs, competitions, and volunteering opportunities. Finally, there is the “Individual” section, a collection of original, intelligent tools to help students plan their future. The EC Calendar allows students to mark upcoming events in a calendarized view to better manage their schedule. The Goal Setter allows students to type in goals that they set for themself and confirm, through a set of prompts, whether the goal is SMART (specific, measurable, accurate, reasonable, and time-sensitive). Lastly, the Tracker allows students to compile a list of their extracurricular opportunities, an extremely useful feature come time for resume building and college admissions.
